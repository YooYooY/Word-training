unordered array

ascending order

first value is the minimum value

compare each other

once you get a value less than one

reassign the minimum

checked all of the values of the array

flip those values 

and then it does this over and over again until the array is sorted

loop through

switch that to one set that with two 

we'll start again at the next stage

======
after this iteration flip i with the minimum value

Temporary variables

greater than 

then we finish this loop so we can convert 

process repeats again
